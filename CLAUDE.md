# shakes-script-scissors

A web tool for interactively cutting Shakespeare scripts for production. Directors and dramaturgs can load any play, mark cuts, track before/after line counts, manage multiple cut iterations, assign actors to roles (double-casting), and export individual actor cue scripts.

## Dev Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start dev server at http://localhost:3000
npm run build    # Production build
npm run lint     # ESLint check
npx tsc --noEmit # TypeScript check (no build output)
```

## Updating Play Texts

**DraCor plays (37 of 38)**: Pull the submodule.
```bash
cd shakedracor && git pull origin main && cd ..
git add shakedracor && git commit -m "chore: update DraCor submodule"
```

**The Two Noble Kinsmen (Folger source)**: Check for updates at the `folgerSource` URL in `FolgerClient.ts`, then re-run the normalizer.
```bash
curl -o /tmp/TNK-raw.xml https://www.folgerdigitaltexts.org/download/xml/TNK.xml
python3 scripts/normalize-folger-tei.py /tmp/TNK-raw.xml shakedracor/tei/the-two-noble-kinsmen.xml
cd shakedracor && git add tei/the-two-noble-kinsmen.xml && git commit -m "chore: update TNK from Folger" && cd ..
git add shakedracor && git commit -m "chore: update TNK submodule ref"
```
Both updates should be done together whenever play texts are refreshed.

## Architecture

**Stack**: Next.js 16 App Router · TypeScript · Tailwind v4 · fast-xml-parser
**Storage**: Browser `localStorage` + JSON file export/import (no database, no auth)
**Data source**: DraCor API (`https://dracor.org/api/v1/corpora/shake/plays/{slug}/tei`) — same Folger TEI data, cleaner endpoint

## Key Files

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `lib/folger/FolgerClient.ts` | Fetches TEI XML from DraCor; `PLAYS` array maps `id` → `slug` |
| `lib/folger/TeiParser.ts` | Parses TEI XML into `Play` domain objects; sets `stageType` + `isSong` on SDs; extracts `castList` names verbatim from TEI (handles both `<role><name>` and bare `<role>` formats); stores raw `<speaker>` text as `Speech.speakerTag` |
| `lib/folger/PlayCache.ts` | LRU in-memory cache for parsed plays (server-side) |
| `lib/cuts/CutEngine.ts` | Pure fn: `(Play, Cut, assignments, actors)` → `LineCounts` + filtered units |
| `lib/cuts/StageTimeEngine.ts` | Computes per-character on-stage time from entrance/exit SDs; returns cut vs original minutes |
| `lib/cuts/CueScriptBuilder.ts` | Builds per-actor cue scripts from cut play |
| `lib/cuts/CastingUtils.ts` | `suggestMinimumCast` (Welsh–Powell graph colouring) + `buildForbiddenPairs` (quick-change-aware doubling constraints) |
| `lib/cuts/QuickChangeEngine.ts` | `computeQuickChanges` — walks scenes to find actor quick-changes below the threshold; warnings include act/scene/line locations |
| `lib/project/ProjectStore.tsx` | React context + localStorage persistence; all project mutations |
| `lib/project/projectUtils.ts` | `generateId()`, `defaultColors` (reds + greens excluded — reserved for UI indicators), `resolveCharacterName(charId, aliases, castList)` |
| `lib/project/projectIO.ts` | JSON export (file download) and import (file picker + Zod validation); `exportProject` / `importProject` |
| `app/api/play/[playId]/route.ts` | GET: fetch + parse + cache a play; returns `Play` JSON |
| `app/api/plays/route.ts` | GET: returns `PLAYS` listing |

## Data Models (types/)

### `Play` (parsed from TEI, never stored)
- `acts[]` → `scenes[]` → `units[]` (Speech | StageDirection)
- `Act`: `id`, `number`, `title`, `scenes[]`, `divType?` (`"prologue"|"epilogue"|"induction"` — undefined means a regular act)
- `Scene`: `id`, `number`, `title`, `units[]`, `sceneType?` (`"chorus"|"epilogue"|"prologue"` — undefined means a regular scene)
- `Speech`: `characterId` (e.g. `#Hamlet_Ham`), `characterName`, `speakerTag` (raw `<speaker>` tag text verbatim, e.g. `"GHOST OF HAMLET'S FATHER"`), `deliveryNote?` (pre-speech delivery qualifier, e.g. `"[within]"`, shown inline after the character name), `lines[]`, `lineCount`
- `StageDirection`: `id`, `text`, `characters[]`, `stageType?` (`"entrance"|"exit"|"business"|"delivery"`), `isSong?`, `isDance?`
- `Line`: `id`, `ftln` (Folger through-line number), `text`, `isSong?`, `poemIndent?` (B-rhyme in a poem stanza → indented), `partIndent?` (part="F"/part="I"+prev — shared verse fragment → proportionally indented), `partIndentChars?` (char count of preceding parts, drives indent width)

### `Project` (stored as JSON in localStorage)
- `name?: string` — optional display name (e.g. "2026 Production"); distinct from `playTitle`
- `cuts[]`: each cut has:
  - `cutMap: Record<unitId, "cut"|"kept">` — speech-level cuts
  - `lineCutMap?: Record<lineId, "cut"|"kept">` — individual line cuts within speeches
  - `stageDirectionEdits?: Record<sdId, string[]>` — full override of character list per SD
  - `sceneOrder?: string[]` — custom scene ordering (for reordering scenes)
  - `speechEdits?: Record<unitId, SpeechEdit>` — word-level track-changes edits
  - `speechReassignments?: Record<unitId, characterId>` — re-attributes a speech to a different character; afterCut counts route to the new character, original counts stay on the original
  - `characterAliases?: Record<characterId, string>` — display-name overrides per character for this cut; never alters underlying Play data; propagated to all render sites (script, line counts, matrix, cue scripts)
  - `characterLinks?: Array<[charIdA, charIdB]>` — director-specified pairs that must share the same actor; IDs stored in sorted order for stable equality checks; fed into Suggest as `sameActorPairs` overrides, which take precedence over quick-change forbidden pairs; per-cut, cloned when duplicating a cut
  - `stageDurations?: Record<stageId | speechId, number>` — director-specified extra minutes for song/dance SDs or speeches; added to total and scene running times but not attributed to individual characters
  - `pauses?: Record<"after:{sceneId}", { name: string; minutes: number }>` — named intermissions inserted between scenes; duration adds to total running time
- `actors[]`: name + color hex
- `assignments[]`: `characterId` → `actorId` (double-casting: one actor → many characters)
- `settings?: { wordsPerMinute: number; quickChangeThresholdMinutes?: number }` — used for stage time and quick-change calculations
- Export file extension: `.sss.json`

## TEI Parsing Notes

The DraCor TEI format uses:
- `<l xml:id="ftln-N">` for verse lines
- `<p xml:id="p-N"><lb xml:id="ftln-N"/>text</p>` for prose (multiple `<lb>` per `<p>` = multiple lines)
- `<lg xml:id="stz-N">` for stanzas/songs (contains `<l>` children)
- `<l part="I|F" prev="#ftln-N">` — shared verse lines split across speakers; `part="I"` (no prev) starts the chain, `part="I"+prev` marks middle fragments, `part="F"` closes it; `partIndentChars` stores the cumulative preceding-text length for proportional indentation
- `<stage>` elements inside `<sp>`: pre-first-line stages (e.g. `<stage type="location">, within</stage>`) become `Speech.deliveryNote`; stages that appear between lines split the speech into multiple `Speech` + `StageDirection` units
- Top-level body divs: `act`, `prologue`, `epilogue`, `induction` — all collected in document order; `divType` on `Act` distinguishes non-act structural divs
- Scene-level div types: `scene`, `chorus`, `epilogue`, `prologue` — `sceneType` on `Scene` distinguishes non-scene units
- `<div type="act" n="1">` and `<div type="scene" n="1">`
- `<sp who="#CharId_PlayId">` for speeches
- `<castItem sameAs="#CharId_PlayId">` for cast list
- `<stage type="entrance|exit|...">` for stage directions (type drives on-stage tracking)

`fast-xml-parser` is configured with `preserveOrder: true` so elements maintain document order.

**Two `<castItem>` formats** handled by the parser:
- `<role><name>King Claudius</name></role>` — named characters (has `<name>` child)
- `<role>A Lord</role>` — minor characters (text directly in `<role>`, no `<name>` child)
TEI-authored names are used verbatim; `normalizeCharacterName` is only applied to the ID-stem as a last-resort fallback when no TEI name exists.

**Known DraCor data gaps**: Some exit SDs are missing characters (e.g. "All but Hamlet exit" may omit Voltemand/Cornelius). Use the SD character editor to fix per-production.

## Line Counts (verified)
- MND: 2200 spoken lines (1749 verse `<l>` + 451 prose `<lb>`) ✓
- Hamlet: ~4058 spoken lines ✓

## Stage Time Engine (`lib/cuts/StageTimeEngine.ts`)

On-stage tracking uses **entrance/exit SDs only** — no fallback from speech presence.

- `onStageOrig`: driven by `sd.characters` (raw TEI data, unaffected by edits)
- `onStage`: driven by `getEffectiveCharacters(sd, edits)` (applies `stageDirectionEdits`)
- Time accumulates for **all characters currently on stage** per speech, not just the speaker
- Adding a character to an SD → their **cut** stage time increases; original unchanged
- Removing a character from an SD → their **cut** stage time decreases; original unchanged

`StageTimeResult` returns:
- `byCharacter`: `{ minutes, originalMinutes, scenes[] }` per character
- `totalMinutes` / `originalTotalMinutes`: total show duration
- `warnings`: `Array<{ characterId, type: "no-exit" | "no-entrance" }>` — characters with kept speeches but no matching entrance/exit SD anywhere in the play. Filtered to non-empty `characterId` to skip TEI data gaps (`<sp>` with no `who=` attribute).

## Doubling Conflict Detection (`CastingManager.tsx`)

`computeSimultaneousMap` walks entrance/exit SDs to build `Map<charId, Set<charId>>` of characters ever simultaneously on stage. From this:
- `conflictCount` badge (⚠ N) on a character card = N of their simultaneous partners share the same assigned actor
- Actor dropdown shows `⚠ ActorName` as a **pre-warning** before assigning, if that actor is already assigned to a simultaneous-on-stage character

### Quick-change warnings (`lib/cuts/QuickChangeEngine.ts`)

`computeQuickChanges` detects actor turnaround gaps below `settings.quickChangeThresholdMinutes` (default 2.0 min). Each `QuickChangeWarning` carries:
- `exitSceneId` / `enterSceneId` — which scenes contain the costume change
- `exitActNum`, `exitSceneNum`, `exitApproxLine` — 1-based act and scene numbers, plus scene-relative original-text line count at point of exit
- `enterActNum`, `enterSceneNum`, `enterApproxLine` — same for the entrance
- `gapMinutes` — gap between exit and entrance in estimated minutes

Displayed in `CastingManager` as a two-row card per warning:
```
[actor name] exits as [Char A] → enters as [Char B]  (X.Xm gap)
  Act 1, scene 2: ~l.47 → Act 1, scene 4: ~l.0  (original lines)
```

`exitApproxLine` counts all speech `lineCount`s in the scene up to that point regardless of cut status, so the number matches the uncut script for physical reference.

## Character Aliases (`Cut.characterAliases`)

Per-cut display-name overrides stored as `Record<characterId, string>`. Key behaviours:
- **Never alters `Play` data** — the TEI character ID and cast-list name are untouched
- **Propagated everywhere** via `resolveCharacterName(charId, aliases, castList)` in `lib/project/projectUtils.ts`; falls back to `characterIdToName(charId)` if no cast entry
- **Alias editing in CharacterCard**: hover the character name → pencil icon → inline `<input>` → Enter/blur to confirm; original TEI name shown in muted text below when an alias is set
- **Cue script**: `buildCueScript` accepts `characterAliases` and uses resolved names for character headers and speaker labels
- **Cloned with the cut**: duplicating a cut copies `characterAliases`; aliases are independent per cut
- Cleared by setting `alias = null` (key is deleted from the map)

## Character Links (`Cut.characterLinks`)

Director-specified same-actor pairs stored as `Array<[charIdA, charIdB]>` (IDs in lexicographic order for stable equality). Key behaviours:
- **UI**: sky-blue pills below the line-count area on each CharacterCard; `+ link` button opens an inline `<select>` of unlinked characters; × button removes the link; link is bidirectional (both cards show the pill)
- **Store action**: `TOGGLE_CHARACTER_LINK` adds the sorted pair if absent, removes it if present
- **Suggest integration**: links feed into `handleSuggest` as additional `sameActorPairs`, which union-find merges before graph colouring — this overrides any quick-change forbidden-pair constraint between the linked characters, encoding the director's dramaturgical decision
- **Help text**: `?` button in CastingManager header shows a panel explaining the graph-colouring algorithm, quick-change threshold, and how links work

## Minimum Cast Suggestion (`lib/cuts/CastingUtils.ts`)

`suggestMinimumCast(speakingCharIds, simultaneousMap, options)` finds the minimum actor count using Welsh–Powell greedy graph colouring:

1. **`buildForbiddenPairs(play, cut, settings)`** — walks the cut play tracking cumulative minutes; any actor pair with gap < `quickChangeThresholdMinutes` is added to the forbidden set
2. **Sort by degree × line count** — characters sorted descending by simultaneous-pair count (most constrained first), tie-broken by line count
3. **Union-find for same-actor merges** — `sameActorPairs` (from existing assignments + character links) are merged into groups; each group is coloured as a unit
4. **Greedy colouring** — each character (or merged group) is assigned the lowest-indexed slot not used by any simultaneous-on-stage neighbour or forbidden-pair neighbour
5. **"Prefer least-loaded" slot** — among valid slots, picks the one with the fewest total lines to balance the cast

Result displayed in CastingManager as a preview panel: "Suggested minimum: N actors" → grouped character lists → **Apply** (creates `Actor` objects with `defaultColors`, dispatches `BULK_SET_CAST`) / **Dismiss**.

## UI Color Conventions

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Amber | Baseline / unchanged |
| Red | Cut (lines removed, stage time reduced) |
| Green | Addition (character added to SD, stage time exceeds original) |
| Actor colors | Blue, amber, violet, teal, fuchsia, slate, orange, cyan — **no reds or greens** |

## View Modes (`lib/ui/ViewModeContext.tsx`)

Three modes toggled from the Script nav dropdown:
- **Standard** (`"standard"`) — cuts shown with strikethrough (default)
- **Clean** (`"clean"`) — cut speeches/SDs hidden; final script only
- **Diff** (`"diff"`) — side-by-side: modified left, original right (`DiffView.tsx`)

## MetricContext (`lib/ui/MetricContext.tsx`)

Global context providing `metric: "lines" | "words" | "time"` and `wpm: number` (synced from `project.settings.wordsPerMinute`). Act and scene headers read from this to display the correct unit. Switching to the Time tab in `LineCountPanel` sets `metric = "time"`, which causes all act/scene headers to show minutes instead of counts.

## Character ID Normalization (`lib/folger/TeiParser.ts`)

`characterIdToName(id: string): string` — exported utility that converts a raw TEI character ID (e.g. `#PLAYERS_Ham`, `#SOLDIERS.FORTINBRAS_Ham`) to a readable name using the same normalization as the cast list. Used as a fallback in `LineCountPanel` when a character appears in stage directions but has no formal `<castItem>` entry.

## Scene Dashboard (`app/projects/[projectId]/dashboard/`)

Three-tab overview page for production planning. All counts reflect the **cut** (not original) unless noted.

### Tab 1 — Scenes & Pauses (`SceneList.tsx`)
- Lists scenes in `effectiveSceneOrder` with line / word / running-time count for each scene
- **Drag-reorder**: grab handle (`⠿`) to move scenes; amber drop-indicator bar; dispatches `SET_SCENE_ORDER`
- **Insert Pause**: click ⏸ between any two scenes to add a named intermission/break with a duration in minutes; pauses appear in the scene list and are included in total running time

### Tab 2 — Matrix (`DashboardMatrix.tsx`)
- Character × scene grid showing cut-only values (`linesAfterCut`, `wordsAfterCut`, stage-time `minutes`)
- **Actor-grouped column headers**: cast characters grouped under a spanning actor name row (left-aligned, actor-colored); uncast characters in their own group
- **Column click** → filter visible rows to scenes where that character appears; click again to clear
- **Row total** column (right edge) and **column total** footer row; grand total in bottom-right
- Fully-cut scenes (all speeches removed) are dimmed at 30% opacity
- **Table / Chart toggle**: Chart view renders horizontal bars per character sorted by total descending, with actor name column always fixed-width so counts stay aligned

### Tab 3 — Rehearsal (`RehearsalGroupings.tsx`)
Two sections rendered side-by-side:
- **By Actor**: for each actor, list of scenes they appear in (via any of their characters) with cut-only line/word/time values and totals
- **Suggested Rehearsal Blocks**: consecutive scenes sharing at least one actor are grouped into a single "block" (multi-scene blocks only); shows scene range, duration, actor chips, and per-scene breakdown

`SceneDashboard.tsx` orchestrates all tabs: builds `charSceneMatrix` (via `buildCharSceneMatrix` helper) and `actorSceneMatrix` (for SceneList actor presence chips), calls `computeStageTime` and `computeCuts`, derives `cutSceneIds`.

### Tab 4 — Integrity (`IntegrityChecks.tsx`)
Side-by-side columns: **Missing Exit SDs** (left) and **Missing Entrance SDs** (right). Each character appears as an expandable card showing:
- Scenes where they have kept speeches
- Known complementary SD locations (e.g. known entrance when exit is missing) with approximate scene-relative line number (`~l.N`)
- "Both are missing" when neither SD exists

Badge on the tab button shows total warning count. `buildCharDetails` uses `findSdsForChar()` to walk the play counting kept lines before each matching SD to compute the approximate line number.

**Name Diagnostics** — collapsible developer/dramaturg table at the bottom of the Integrity tab. Shows every character's name across all sources side by side: TEI ID, Folger Cast List name, raw `<speaker>` tag text, ID-normalized fallback, SD References (name tokens + pronouns extracted from SD prose, with act/scene/`~l.N` hover tooltips per token), and the resolved display name. SD token extraction filters possessive qualifiers (`"Gravedigger"` excluded from `"Gravedigger's companion"`) and qualified-ID context words (`"Fortinbras"` excluded from `SOLDIERS.FORTINBRAS`). Sky-blue rows have an active alias for the current cut.

`buildCharSceneMatrix` respects `speechReassignments`: original counts go to `unit.characterId`, afterCut counts go to `reassignments[unit.id] ?? unit.characterId`. Fully-cut characters are defined as having all speeches cut AND all entrance/exit SDs cut.

## Speech Reassignment (`SpeechBlock.tsx`)

A speech can be reassigned to a different character via `Cut.speechReassignments?: Record<unitId, characterId>`. In the script view:
- Hover the character name → faint border + `⇄` icon appears above the name; click to open a dropdown
- Once reassigned: original name shown with red strikethrough, new name in green; hover affordance is hidden
- `↩ restore` button appears on hover and clears the reassignment (plus any cuts) in one click
- Reassignment is reflected in dashboard `buildCharSceneMatrix`: afterCut counts route to the new character, original counts stay on the original

## Running Line Counter (`SceneBlock.tsx` + `SpeechBlock.tsx`)

A right-aligned scene-relative line number appears every 5 lines, displayed in `text-stone-700`:
- **Standard mode**: counts ALL lines (including cut ones) — numbers reflect position in the full original text
- **Clean mode**: counts only kept lines — numbers reflect position in the cut script
- **Diff mode**: left column counts kept lines; right column counts all lines (each column independent)

`SceneBlock` pre-computes `speechStartLines: Map<unitId, offset>` before rendering; `SpeechBlock` receives the offset as `speechLineOffset` and builds `lineNumMap` per-line.

## Cue Script Format

For each actor: their lines preceded by the last 2–3 words of the previous speech (the "cue"). Stage directions mentioning their characters are included. Both **entrance and exit** SDs emit a cue entry so the actor knows exactly when to enter or exit. Stage direction character lists respect `stageDirectionEdits`. Printed directly from the browser via `window.print()` with Tailwind `print:` styles.

- **Group 9**: Script Integrity — Dashboard Integrity tab (side-by-side no-exit / no-entrance warnings with scene/line location of complementary SD); speech reassignment (hover char name → dropdown, restore clears it); running scene-relative line counter every 5 lines (mode-aware: Standard=all lines, Clean/Diff=kept lines); fully-cut character defined as all speeches + all entrance/exit SDs cut; CharacterCard shows cut line/word/time counts; actor inline rename + delete-with-confirmation in CastingManager
- **Group 10**: Character aliases (`characterAliases` per-cut, propagated to all render sites including cue scripts); suggest minimum cast (Welsh–Powell graph colouring, quick-change-aware forbidden pairs, union-find for same-actor merges, Apply/Dismiss panel); character links (`characterLinks` per-cut, sky-blue pills on CharacterCard, feed into Suggest as hard same-actor constraints); quick-change warning locations (act/scene/original-line for both exit and entrance)
- **Parser + Diagnostics**: TEI cast list parser fixes — bare `<role>` fallback, removed length-heuristic, verbatim TEI names; `Speech.speakerTag` field (raw `<speaker>` text); Name Diagnostics table in Integrity tab (SD reference token extraction with possessive/qualifier filtering, CSS hover tooltips for act/scene/line locations)

- **Group 11**: "Save / Export ▾" nav dropdown (save JSON or export HTML); dynamic self-contained HTML mini-app export (pre-rendered data + embedded vanilla JS; three view modes Clean/Standard/Diff; character filter sidebar grouped by actor; sticky topbar with mode switcher, scene jump, print button; `@page` margin boxes baked in at export time); PDF cue scripts with `@page` headers (play title/cut name top-left, actor/characters top-right) and footer (page number + timestamp + tool attribution); white background on all print views

- **Group 12**: Settings modal (⚙ gear in nav → project name, WPM, quick-change threshold); copyright/attribution footer (home page) citing DraCor + Folger Editions CC BY-SA 4.0; `SECURITY.md` (allowlist API, localStorage-only, 0 `npm audit` vulns after `npm audit fix`); The Two Noble Kinsmen — not in DraCor corpus, local Folger TEI normalizer (`scripts/normalize-folger-tei.py`) converts raw Folger word-tokenized XML to DraCor-compatible format; mirrored at `shakedracor/tei/the-two-noble-kinsmen.xml`; `noLocal` flag removed; TNK loads with 3,291 lines + 42 cast members

- **Group 13**: Dark mode (`ThemeContext` light/dark/auto, `sss_theme` localStorage key, flat sun/moon/monitor SVG toggle); settings modal expanded — project name, WPM slider with presets (Slow/Amateur/Experienced/Professional), quick-change threshold, theme toggle, Save/Export all in one gear panel; nav decluttered — Cut Selector and Save/Export dropdown moved into settings, scissors-only logo with hover-reveal Shakespeare-head swap + wiggle + "ShakesScriptScissors" label slide-in (overlay, no layout shift); flat SVG icons for all nav links + gear; project title as dashboard link with always-visible DashboardIcon; Dashboard removed from nav links; easter egg: Shakespeare face animation (speech bubble left, quill-circle right) fires on cut-mode exit ("Scratch it out!") and on scene restore-all ("Scratch it back in!"); contrast audit — `dark:text-stone-500` → `dark:text-stone-400` globally for WCAG AA compliance

- **Group 14**: Responsive design — tablet landscape (1024px = `lg:`) as primary breakpoint, mobile (375px) as secondary; nav bar collapses ✂ Cut mode + scene jump behind `☰` hamburger dropdown below `lg:`, nav link labels hide below `md:`, project title responsive `max-w` with truncation; `LineCountPanel` sidebar `hidden lg:block` on desktop, bottom drawer on tablet toggled by floating `≡ Info` pill (`hidden md:block lg:hidden`), fully hidden on mobile; script editor full-width on tablet; `SceneDashboard` header `flex-wrap` + subtabs `overflow-x-auto`; `CastingManager` character grid adds `xl:grid-cols-3`; all via Tailwind `md:`/`lg:`/`xl:` breakpoints + minimal `useState` for drawer toggle

- **Group 15 — Script Features**
  - SD "sync exits" button (renamed from "auto-fill"): pre-fills exit SD character list from on-stage tracking; button label is "⟳ sync exits"
  - Song & dance highlighting: ♪ violet/italic for sung lines, ⊛ cyan for dance SDs; `+ time` inline duration editor on song/dance SDs; durations stored in `Cut.stageDurations` and added to show running time
  - Epilogues, prologues, inductions, and choruses parsed from TEI: `Act.divType`, `Scene.sceneType`; `PROLOGUE`/`EPILOGUE`/`INDUCTION`/`CHORUS` rendered in script and scene jumper (`pr:1`, `ep:1`, `in:1`, `3:ch`)
  - Scene jumper: hidden scenes disabled/dimmed when character/actor filter active; non-standard scene labels (`pr`, `ep`, `ch`, `in`) passed through
  - Poem B-rhyme indentation: odd-position lines in `<lg>` poem stanzas indented per Folger layout
  - Split verse line (shared-line) proportional indentation: `part="F"` and `part="I"+prev=` lines indented by cumulative preceding-part character count in `ch` units
  - Mid-speech stage directions: `<stage>` elements inside `<sp>` split the speech into Speech+StageDirection segments (e.g. "Enter Macbeth with bloody daggers." mid-Lady-Macbeth)
  - Pre-speech delivery notes: `<stage type="location">` before first line becomes `Speech.deliveryNote`, shown as italic `[within]` after the character name

### Not Started (Phase 4+)

#### Group 15 — Script Features (remaining)
- **Split speech**: Allow splitting a `Speech` at a line boundary into two independently cuttable/reassignable units. Data model: `Cut.speechSplits?: Record<unitId, { splitAtLineIndex: number; newCharacterId?: string }>`. UI: hover a line boundary → "Split here" micro-button; a "Merge" button restores. `CutEngine` must expand splits. Critical files: `types/project.ts`, `lib/cuts/CutEngine.ts`, `components/ScriptEditor/SpeechBlock.tsx`.
- **Insert text (full)**: Two modes — **Freestyle** (plain text, assign from cast) and **Borrow from play** (DraCor catalogue picker → scene browser → line multi-select). Data model: `Cut.insertions?: Record<insertionId, { afterUnitId: string; characterId: string; lines: InsertedLine[]; source: "freestyle" | { playId: string; unitId: string } }>`. Inserted units appear with a green left border + "inserted" badge in all view modes. Counts included in line/word totals and cue scripts. New component: `components/ScriptEditor/InsertionBlock.tsx`. Critical files: `types/project.ts`, `lib/cuts/CutEngine.ts`, `lib/cuts/CueScriptBuilder.ts`, `components/ScriptEditor/SpeechBlock.tsx`.

#### Group 16 — TEI Verification + Documentation
- **TEI verification**: Read Folger FDT documentation PDF (user to supply). Verify DraCor endpoint correctness, check for parsing gaps (`<ab>`, nested `<stage>`, etc.). Document findings in CLAUDE.md.
- **Cutting methodology**: User to supply PDF. After reviewing: add "How to cut a play" help section accessible from a `?` button near the Cut mode button. Implementation: inline help panel or `/help` page.
- **Doubling methodology**: User to supply PDF. After reviewing: add "How to double cast" section to CastingManager `?` modal.
- **User-facing docs**: Create `docs/` directory with `GETTING_STARTED.md`, `USER_GUIDE.md`, `FEATURES.md` for non-technical theatre directors/dramaturgs.

#### Stretch / Deferred
- Google Drive backup integration
- GUI/installer for non-technical users (would require Electron or web installer wizard)
